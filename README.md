| 1  | What does ASPICE SYS.2 require? | Based on the context, ASPICE SYS.2 is System Requirements Analysis [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:4, chunk:26]. The analysis involves system requirements which include the functions and capabilities of the system; business, organizational and user requirements; and safety, security, interface, operations, and maintenance requirements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:115, chunk:659]. The requirements should identify the system overview and any interrelationship constraints between system elements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:115, chunk:659]. It also identifies design considerations for each system element, such as memory, hardware interface, user interface, performance, and security requirements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:115, chunk:660]. | Based on the context provided, ASPICE SYS.2 is the System Requirements Analysis process [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:12, chunk:72][doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:4, chunk:26][doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:11, chunk:67]. It is part of the System Engineering process group (SYS) [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:12, chunk:72]. The process includes base practices related to bidirectional traceability (SYS.2 BP6) and consistency (SYS.2 BP7) [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:123, chunk:701]. The provided context does not contain further details on the specific requirements, purpose, or outcomes of the SYS.2 process. |
| 2  | What are the work products expected in ASPICE SYS.1? | Based on the provided context, the output work products for the process preceding SYS.2 (which is SYS.1) are:<br>• 08-19 Risk management plan<br>• 08-20 Risk mitigation plan<br>• 13-04 Communication record<br>• 13-19 Review record<br>• 13-21 Change control record<br>• 15-01 Analysis report<br>• 17-03 Stakeholder Requirements | Insufficient context. |
| 3  | In AUTOSAR ECU State Manager, what is the purpose of RUN state? | Insufficient context. | The purpose of the RUN state is to have the ECU State Manager implement all its activities while the OS is up and running [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:138, chunk:1234]. RUN is a standard state when ECU Mode Handling is used [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:27, chunk:835]. The ECU Manager module arbitrates RUN and POST_RUN requests from software components [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:13, chunk:780]. The mode port of the ECU State Manager module declares RUN as one of its modes, along with STARTUP, POST_RUN, SLEEP, and SHUTDOWN [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:149, chunk:1270]. |
| 4  | How does AUTOSAR ensure a safe transition between ECU states? | AUTOSAR ensures safe transitions between ECU states through the cooperation of the ECU State Manager (EcuM) and the BSW Mode Manager (BswM) [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:92, chunk:1061]. While the EcuM arbitrates requests for state changes from Software Components (SW-Cs), it is the BswM that is responsible for monitoring the ECU and ultimately deciding when a transition to a different mode can be made [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:92, chunk:1061], [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:19, chunk:801].<br>In cases where an error makes it impossible to continue processing, the EcuM can invoke the `EcuM_ErrorHook` [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:124, chunk:1184]. This allows an integrator to define how the ECU is stopped, with options including a reset, halt, or transitioning to a "safe state" [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:124, chunk:1184]. | Based on the provided context, AUTOSAR ensures safe transitions between ECU states through a cooperative mechanism between the ECU State Manager (EcuM) and the BSW Mode Manager (BswM) [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:92, chunk:1061]. ECU states are generally implemented as AUTOSAR modes, and the BswM is responsible for monitoring and affecting the corresponding changes [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:19, chunk:801]. While the EcuM arbitrates requests for mode changes from Software Components (SW-Cs), only the BswM can decide when a transition to a different mode can be made [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:92, chunk:1061].<br>For safety-critical operations, the ECU State Manager must run with a full trust level [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:69, chunk:1003]. Additionally, methods to ensure a proper de-initialization phase must be upheld [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:69, chunk:1003]. In case of an error where processing cannot continue, the ECU must be stopped, and the integrator can choose the modality, such as a reset, halt, or transition to a safe state [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:124, chunk:1184]. The `EcuM_ErrorHook` can be invoked by the ECU Manager module in all phases to handle such errors [doc:AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager, page:124, chunk:1184]. |
| 5  | What is the difference between ASPICE SYS.2 and SWE.1 objectives? | Based on the provided context, SYS.2 is System Requirements Analysis, while SWE.1 is Software Requirements Analysis [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:124, chunk:706]. The SWE.1 process uses the system requirements and the system architecture as inputs to specify the software requirements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:46, chunk:265]. Additionally, consistency and bidirectional traceability are established between system requirements and software requirements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:46, chunk:265]. | Based on the provided context, SYS.2 is named "System Requirements Analysis" and SWE.1 is named "Software Requirements Analysis" [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:122, chunk:695]. The Software Engineering process group (SWE), which includes SWE.1, addresses the management of software requirements that are derived from system requirements [doc:Automotive_SPICE_PAM_31_EN, page:12, chunk:73]. |
